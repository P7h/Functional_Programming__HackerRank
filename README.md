# HackerRank Functional Programming challenges

## Intro
After completing Graham Hutton's ["Programming in Haskell"](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html) Part I, I embarked on honing my FP skills. I came across the Functional Programming Domain and problem sets on HackerRank and felt it will help me in my understanding of the FP realm better.
